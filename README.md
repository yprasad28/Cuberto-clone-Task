 This project showcases my frontend development skills by recreating specific animations and transitions inspired from the Cuberto.com homepage.

## Overview

In this assignment, I have demonstrated my frontend development skills by recreating specific animations and transitions from the Cuberto.com homepage. The objective was to implement modern, smooth animations using technologies like Framer Motion and Shadcn UI components, drawing inspiration from the elegant and seamless design of Cuberto.

## Scope

- I chose a few sections from the Cuberto.com homepage to recreate, focusing on those with interesting animations and transitions.
- The goal was not to clone the entire homepage but to perfect the implementation of selected elements.

## Technologies

- **Next.js**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Framer Motion** for animations.
- **Shadcn UI** for components.
- **TypeScript**.

## Focus Areas

- **Smooth transitions between elements**
- **Hover animations**
- **Scroll-triggered animations**
- **Clean, responsive implementation**
